# Machine Learning Project Repository

## About This Project
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects, each demonstrating different techniques and algorithms using TensorFlow and Keras. The projects cover a range of applications, from image classification to regression and recommendation systems.

## Built With
- **TensorFlow**: Core framework for building and training machine learning models.
- **Keras**: High-level API for TensorFlow.
- **Python**: Programming language for implementation.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization tools.

## Projects
1. **Cat and Dog Classification**:
   - Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of cats and dogs.
2. **Book Recommendation System**:
   - Implements K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to recommend books based on user preferences.
3. **SMS Spam Classification**:
   - Uses Neural Networks (NNs) to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam.
4. **Health Cost Prediction**:
   - Predicts health insurance costs using regression techniques.
